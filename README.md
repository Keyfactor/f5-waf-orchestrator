## Overview

The Fortigate Orchestrator Extension supports the following use cases:
1. Inventory of local user and factory cerificates
2. Ability to add new local certificates
3. Ability to renew **unbound** local user certificates
4. Ability to delete **unbound** local user certificates

The Fortigate Orchestrator Extension DOES NOT support the following use cases:
1. The renewal or removal of certificates enrolled through the internal Fortigate CA
2. The renewal or removal of factory certificates
3. The renewal or removal of ANY certificate bound to a Fortigate object
4. Certificate enrollment using the internal Fortigate CA (Keyfactor's "reenrollment" or "on device key generation" use case)

The F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension implements 2 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to use one, or both of these Certificate Store Types. Descriptions of each are provided below.

## Compatibility

This integration is compatible with Keyfactor Universal Orchestrator version 10.4.1 and later.

## Support
The F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension is supported by Keyfactor for Keyfactor customers. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket with your Keyfactor representative. If you have a support issue, please open a support ticket via the Keyfactor Support Portal at https://support.keyfactor.com. 
 
> To report a problem or suggest a new feature, use the **[Issues](../../issues)** tab. If you want to contribute actual bug fixes or proposed enhancements, use the **[Pull requests](../../pulls)** tab.

## Requirements & Prerequisites

Before installing the F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension, we recommend that you install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.


The Fortigate Orchestrator Extension requires an API token be created in the Fortigate environment being managed.  Please review the following [instructions](https://docs.fortinet.com/document/forticonverter/7.0.1/online-help/866905/connect-fortigate-device-via-api-token) for creating an API token to be used in this integration.

## Create Certificate Store Types

To use the F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension, you **must** create the Certificate Store Types required for your usecase. This only needs to happen _once_ per Keyfactor Command instance.

The F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension implements 2 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to use one, or both of these Certificate Store Types.

## Installation

1. **Download the latest F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension from GitHub.** 

    Navigate to the [F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension GitHub version page](https://github.com/Keyfactor/f5-waf-orchestrator/releases/latest). Refer to the compatibility matrix below to determine whether the `net6.0` or `net8.0` asset should be downloaded. Then, click the corresponding asset to download the zip archive.
    | Universal Orchestrator Version | Latest .NET version installed on the Universal Orchestrator server | `rollForward` condition in `Orchestrator.runtimeconfig.json` | `f5-waf-orchestrator` .NET version to download |
    | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
    | Older than `11.0.0` | | | `net6.0` |
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net6.0` | | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `Disable` | `net6.0` | 
    | Between `11.0.0` and `11.5.1` (inclusive) | `net8.0` | `LatestMajor` | `net8.0` | 
    | `11.6` _and_ newer | `net8.0` | | `net8.0` |

    Unzip the archive containing extension assemblies to a known location.

    > **Note** If you don't see an asset with a corresponding .NET version, you should always assume that it was compiled for `net6.0`.

2. **Locate the Universal Orchestrator extensions directory.**

    * **Default on Windows** - `C:\Program Files\Keyfactor\Keyfactor Orchestrator\extensions`
    * **Default on Linux** - `/opt/keyfactor/orchestrator/extensions`
    
3. **Create a new directory for the F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension inside the extensions directory.**
        
    Create a new directory called `f5-waf-orchestrator`.
    > The directory name does not need to match any names used elsewhere; it just has to be unique within the extensions directory.

4. **Copy the contents of the downloaded and unzipped assemblies from __step 2__ to the `f5-waf-orchestrator` directory.**

5. **Restart the Universal Orchestrator service.**

    Refer to [Starting/Restarting the Universal Orchestrator service](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/StarttheService.htm).


6. **(optional) PAM Integration** 

    The F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension is compatible with all supported Keyfactor PAM extensions to resolve PAM-eligible secrets. PAM extensions running on Universal Orchestrators enable secure retrieval of secrets from a connected PAM provider.

    To configure a PAM provider, [reference the Keyfactor Integration Catalog](https://keyfactor.github.io/integrations-catalog/content/pam) to select an extension, and follow the associated instructions to install it on the Universal Orchestrator (remote).


> The above installation steps can be supplimented by the [official Command documentation](https://software.keyfactor.com/Core-OnPrem/Current/Content/InstallingAgents/NetCoreOrchestrator/CustomExtensions.htm?Highlight=extensions).



## Defining Certificate Stores

The F5 WAF Universal Orchestrator extension implements 2 Certificate Store Types, each of which implements different functionality. Refer to the individual instructions below for each Certificate Store Type that you deemed necessary for your use case from the installation section.
